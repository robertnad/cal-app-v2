## Fixes to previous version

No problems after refresh

Removed chunks of code from components and moved it to utils folder

Button components listed from single array containing objects with data for every visible day (button components were previously composed by iterating through 2 arrays of days and hours)

Used CSS grid - divided the appointment grid in 7 fractions representing day columns.

## To do:

De-hardcode random assignments

Convert useState to useReducer
